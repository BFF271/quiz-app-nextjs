## My process

### Built with

- Flexbox
- CSS Grid- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

This was a Really a good challenge, I practice fetch api and Arrays method, React hooks(useState, useEffect).

how i merge the correct answers with incorrect answers and sort them randomly ðŸ˜€ :

```js
const answers = [
  ...questionObj.incorrect_answers,
  questionObj.correct_answer
].sort((a, b) => 0.5 - Math.random());
```

### Useful resources

- [Question API](https://opentdb.com/api_config.php) - This is an amazing Api let config what kind of question to get .
- [course Link](https://scrimba.com/learn/learnreact) - This really good course because every time ask you to try do the tasks with your own.
